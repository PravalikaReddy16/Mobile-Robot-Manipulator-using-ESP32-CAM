# Mobile-Robot-Manipulator-using-ESP32-CAM
Developed a Wi-Fi-controlled mobile manipulator using ESP32-CAM with real-time video streaming and WebSocket teleoperation. Integrated a 4-DOF servo arm and modular gripper. Implemented visual localization using OpenCV (ORB/SURF) for mapping. Built a custom HTML/JS interface for remote control, programmed in C++ and Python via Arduino IDE
